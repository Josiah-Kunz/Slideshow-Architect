RGSS3:
-Events not overlapping properly to connected maps (warp to the map 'Test2' and look at the Amoonguss).
	-Strangely enough, if you warp to the map 'Test' and look at the same Amoonguss it looks fine.
-Doubles battles are in rough shape.

LP Mode:
-Under reconstruction! Rewriting a lot of things --I wouldn't attempt to even test it right now.
-Problem using battle items either in the field or in battle (e.g. Pokéball) from the LP UI.
-Need Registered Items functionality

MISC:
-Mouse wheel script works, but kills the FPS. Does anyone have more experience in this matter?
